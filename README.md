# Memory-Augmented Code Assistant: Automatic README Generation for Large Repositories

This project aims to automatically analyze large code repositories lacking proper documentation, summarize their code structure, and generate high-quality README files that help developers quickly understand complex codebases.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The system scans an entire code repository, analyzes its structure and content, and produces a comprehensive README that includes:

- Project description and purpose
- Installation and setup instructions
- File structure with descriptions
- Key components and their relationships
- Technologies and dependencies used
- Basic usage examples

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

Our approach uses a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Code Analysis**: Extract repository structure, important functions, classes, dependencies, and code comments using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing
2. **Information Processing**: Generate embeddings for code artifacts and store them in a vector database
3. **Context-Aware Summarization**: Leverage large language models to query and synthesize information from the vector database
4. **README Generation**: Structure the extracted insights into a standardized, human-readable README format

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate our system using the following metrics:

- **ROUGE-L**: Measures sequence overlap between generated and reference READMEs
- **BERTScore**: Semantic similarity evaluation using contextual embeddings
- **BLEU**: N-gram precision between generated and reference text
- **METEOR**: Evaluates machine translation quality
- **FKGL**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level to assess readability
- **WMD**: Word Mover's Distance for semantic similarity

## üìã Project Status

Current progress:
- [x] Project setup and requirements definition
- [x] Research on existing solutions and baselines
- [x] Data collection and preprocessing
- [x] AST-based code structure extraction
- [ ] Vector database integration
- [ ] README generation module
- [ ] Evaluation pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## üîÑ Comparison with Existing Solutions

We build upon but differentiate from existing tools:
- **readme-ai**: Our approach focuses on more robust code understanding through improved embedding strategies
- **RepoAgent**: We emphasize better hierarchical representation of code structures
- **Cursor-AI**: Unlike IDE-specific solutions, we provide a standalone tool for documentation generation
