## Installation
To install scikit-learn, you can use pip with the following command:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, you can install it with conda:
```bash
conda install scikit-learn
```
Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed to avoid compatibility issues.

## Components
Key components of the scikit-learn library include:

- **Estimators**: Implementations of various machine learning algorithms, such as classifiers and regressors.
- **Model Selection**: Tools for model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilities for scaling, transforming, and encoding data.
- **Metrics**: Functions for measuring the performance of your models.

## Usage
Here are some basic examples of how to use scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=42)

# Train a model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

## API Overview
### Core Functions and Classes

- **`RandomForestClassifier`**: A variant of the ensemble method used for classification tasks.
- **`train_test_split`**: A utility function to split datasets into training and testing sets.
- **`accuracy_score`**: A metric to evaluate the accuracy of a classification model.

### Example of using a function
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Evaluate accuracy
score = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {score:.2f}')
```

### Custom Configurations
The library allows users to set global configurations for better performance:

```python
from sklearn import set_config
set_config(display='diagram')  # Display estimators as diagrams in Jupyter
```
