## Installation
To install Scikit-learn, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure you have Python installed.** Scikit-learn works with Python 3.6 and later.
2. **Use pip to install the package:**
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Optional:** If you want to install with additional options, you may include dependencies for specific functionalities such as:
   ```bash
   pip install "scikit-learn[alldeps]"
   ```

## Components
- **Core Library (`sklearn`)**: Contains all main components for machine learning tasks, including classifiers, regressors, and clustering.
- **Examples (`examples`)**: Practical scripts demonstrating how to use various functionalities of Scikit-learn.
- **Benchmarks (`benchmarks`)**: Performance tests for comparing Scikit-learn implementations with other libraries.
- **Testing (`tests`)**: Unit tests and testing utilities to ensure robust and bug-free code.
- **Documentation (`doc`)**: All relevant documentation for users and developers.

## Usage
To get started using Scikit-learn, you can implement common machine learning patterns as shown in the following example:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a random forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

# Fit the model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the testing set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```
