# Scikit-Learn Project
Scikit-learn is a powerful and open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis and machine learning tasks, built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Installation
To set up the Scikit-learn library, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Install scikit-learn using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

3. You may also want to install the optional dependencies for better performance:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
   ```

## Components
The Scikit-learn library consists of various modules, each fulfilling a distinct purpose:

- **Datasets**: Contains utilities to load and generate datasets.
- **Decomposition**: Implements dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA.
- **Tree**: Implements decision trees and tree-based estimators.
- **Metrics**: Provides functions to evaluate the performance of models.
- **Utils**: Contains utility functions for discovering functionalities within the library.

### Key Files
- `sklearn/datasets/descr/__init__.py`: Package initializer for dataset description.
- `sklearn/utils/discovery.py`: Utilities to discover scikit-learn objects.
- `examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_X_Y.py`: Various scripts illustrating release highlights for different Scikit-learn versions, demonstrating new features and enhancements.

## Usage
Here are some basic examples to get you started with Scikit-learn.

### Importing Necessary Libraries
Before using Scikit-learn, you need to import it along with other libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

### Basic Workflow Example
```python
# Generate synthetic data
X, y = np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and fit the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

## API Overview
### 1. Functions in Utilities
- **`all_functions()`**: Retrieves a list of all functions from the scikit-learn library.

   ```python
   from sklearn.utils.discovery import all_functions
   functions = all_functions()
   ```

### 2. Configuration Management
- **`set_config()`**: Set global configuration options for Scikit-learn.

   ```python
   from sklearn import set_config
   set_config(display='diagram')
   ```

### 3. OpenMP Parallelism Test
- **`test_openmp_parallelism_enabled()`**: Tests if OpenMP parallelism is enabled for optimized performance.

   ```python
   test_openmp_parallelism_enabled()
   ```

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Various evaluation metrics** provided in the `sklearn.metrics` module like:
  - `accuracy_score`
  - `f1_score`
  - `roc_auc_score`

### 5. Example Visualization
- Various plotting examples available in the `examples` directory that demonstrates features such as release highlights, model selection, and feature selection.
