# Flask Project
Flask is a powerful, lightweight, and extensible web application framework for Python. It allows developers to create web applications from simple prototypes to complex, large-scale applications with a great degree of flexibility. Its primary goals include simplicity, modularity, and ease of integration with other libraries.

## Project Structure
Here's the directory structure for the Flask project, illustrating the organization of files and directories:

```

```

## Installation
To set up the Flask project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask.git
   cd flask
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:** 
   You can start the development server with the following command (you may need to import your app as necessary):
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Components
- **`.editorconfig`**: Helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors.
- **`README.md`**: Provides a detailed overview of the project.
- **`src/`**: Contains the core Flask GSVI application code.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests to ensure functionality and stability of the application.
- **`docs/`**: Contains formatted documentation detailing usage and features of Flask.
- **`examples/`**: Real-world examples of applications built with Flask.

## Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to create and configure a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask

def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return "Hello, World!"
    
    return app
```

You can run this example by placing it in a file and running the Flask development server.

## API Overview
Key files and functionality in the Flask framework include:

- **`src/flask/app.py`**: The principal class `Flask` which creates a WSGI application.
- **`src/flask/sansio/app.py`**: Implements an asynchronous WSGI application handling.
- **`examples/tutorial/flaskr/__init__.py`**: Contains the `create_app` function to initialize your application settings.
- **`tests/test_basic.py`**: Contains multiple test functions ensuring the basic functionalities work as expected.
