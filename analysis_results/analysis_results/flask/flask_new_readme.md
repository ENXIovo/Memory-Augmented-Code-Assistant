# Flask SansIO Application
A versatile Flask application framework that implements a WSGI application with added functionality through the SansIO approach, enabling better handling of asynchronous web interactions.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Make sure to set up an appropriate environment for Flask, including configurations pertaining to your database or any other resources.

## Components
The project consists of several key files and modules:

- **`src/flask/sansio/app.py`** - Implements the core `App` class serving as a WSGI application.
- **`src/flask/app.py`** - Main Flask application functionalities featuring the `Flask` class.
- **`src/flask/sansio/scaffold.py`** - Contains shared behaviors and utility functions for scaffold management.
- **`examples/javascript/js_example/__init__.py`** - Package initializer for a JavaScript example integration.
- **`examples/tutorial/flaskr/__init__.py`** - Sets up the Flask application instance with routing and configurations.
- **`tests/...`** - Includes various test modules for validating application functionality and behavior.

## Usage
To use the application, create an instance of the Flask app and define your views:

```python
# In your main application file
from src.flask.sansio.app import App

app = App(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Hello, Flask SansIO!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## API Overview

### Main Classes
- **`App`**
  - A subclass of a Flask application facilitating additional asynchronous functionality.
  
- **`Flask`**
  - The main application class for building standard Flask applications.

### Key Functions
- **`create_app()`**
  - Initializes and configures a Flask application instance. Example usage can be found in `examples/tutorial/flaskr/__init__.py`.

- **Asynchronous Views**
  - Implemented in the application to enhance performance and user experience during longer requests. See `async/await` usage in `tests/test_async.py`.

### Utility Functions
- **`_make_timedelta()`**
  - A utility function to generate a timedelta object from input values.

- **Common methods in `scaffold.py`:**
  - `setupmethod()`, `wrapper_func()`, `_endpoint_from_view_func()` - These functions are critical for managing request handling and view functions in your app.
