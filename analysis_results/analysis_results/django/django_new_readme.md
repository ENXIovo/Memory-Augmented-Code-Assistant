# Django Project Structure

A template for setting up a Django project with various components, utilities, and tests to facilitate development.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-project-structure.git
   cd django-project-structure
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your database:**
   Configure your `DATABASES` settings in `settings.py`.

5. **Run the migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   
## Components

The project includes the following important files and modules:

- **manage.py**: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- **Settings and Configuration**: Defined in `django/conf/__init__.py`, includes classes like `SettingsReference` and `LazySettings`.
- **Templates**: Managed under the `django/template/` directory with context processors and engine files.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions in `django/utils/` such as `render`, `redirect`, and cryptographic functions in `django/utils/crypto.py`.
- **Models**: Defined models in `django/db/models/__init__.py` and custom models in your `tests` directory.

## Usage

Here are typical workflows that define the usage of this project:

### Creating a New Project

Use the command:

```bash
python manage.py startproject myproject
```

### Creating Models

Define models in the `models.py` file within your app directory. For example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Registering Models to Admin

In `admin.py`, you can register models to be accessible through Django's admin interface:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Article

admin.site.register(Article)
```

## API Overview

### Key Functions and Classes

- **AdminSite**: Encapsulates the Django admin application, allowing for model registration and URL access.
  
  - `register(model_or_iterable, admin_class=None, **options)`: Registers models with the admin interface.
  
  - `get_model_admin(model)`: Returns the registered admin class for a model.

- **Command** (in `startproject.py`): 
  - **handle()**: Handles project creation logic, generating a structure for the new Django project.
  
### Useful Shortcuts

- `django_project_redirect(request)`: A sample function to redirect to Django's official website.

- `csrf` (in `django/template/context_processors.py`): Function that adds CSRF tokens to the template context.
