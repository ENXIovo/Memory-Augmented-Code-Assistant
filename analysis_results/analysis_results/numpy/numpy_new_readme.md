# NumPy
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Installation
To install NumPy, you can use pip, the Python package manager. In your terminal or command prompt, run the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Alternatively, you can install it using conda:
```bash
conda install numpy
```

## Components
This project is structured into several important modules and packages:

- **numpy**: The main package containing all of NumPy's functionality.
  - **core**: Contains core functionalities including ndarray, ufuncs, and dtypes.
  - **lib**: A space for utility functions that aren't specifically tied to the core array features.
  - **ma**: Contains functionality for masked arrays.
  - **rec**: Supports record arrays.
  - **random**: Implements random number generators and distributions.
  - **distutils**: Utilities for building and installing NumPy, including setup configurations.
  - **typing**: Type hinting definitions for NumPy.

## Usage
Here are some typical workflows you can achieve with NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Create a 2D array
array_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Perform basic operations
sum_array = np.sum(array_1d)  # Sum of elements
mean_array = np.mean(array_2d)  # Mean of elements

# Reshape the array
reshaped_array = array_1d.reshape((5, 1))
```

## API Overview
Key functionalities provided by NumPy include:

- `numpy.array()`: Creates an ndarray from a list or tuple.
- `numpy.arange()`: Generates arrays with regularly spaced values.
- `numpy.zeros()`, `numpy.ones()`: Generate arrays filled with zeros or ones.
- `numpy.sum()`: Computes the sum of array elements.
- `numpy.mean()`: Computes the arithmetic mean.

### Additional Key Classes and Functions
- **ndarray**: The core data structure of NumPy, supports various operations and functionalities.
- **ufuncs (Universal Functions)**: Functions that operate element-wise on arrays, allowing for extensive mathematical operations directly on ndarrays.
- **types**: Provides definitions for various NumPy data types.
