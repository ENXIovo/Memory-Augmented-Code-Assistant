   print(torch.rand(5, 3))
   ```

## Components
Here’s an outline of some important components and files within the project:

- **`tools/build_libtorch.py`**: A script to build the libtorch.
- **`torch/utils/_exposed_in.py`**: Contains utility functions for PyTorch.
- **`torch/ao/nn/qat/__init__.py`**: Package initializer for quantization-aware training (QAT) modules.
- **`torch/nn/common_types.py`**: Holds common types used in neural network layers.
- **`test/cpp_api_parity/utils.py`**: Utility functions for C++ API tests.

## Usage
You can use PyTorch for various machine learning and deep learning tasks. Below is an example of how to create a simple neural network:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple feedforward neural network
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)

# Instantiate the model, define a loss function and an optimizer
model = SimpleNN()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Example input
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 10)
output = model(input_tensor)

print("Output of the network:", output)
```

## API Overview
Here are some key functions and modules:

- **`torch.nn`**: Contains various neural network modules, such as layers and loss functions.
